			-
				-
					Life, joy, and freedom, these are those that are good, but to ask why such is

			-
				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 8

				-
			-
				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 18
			-
				-
					To do what one wills so long as society wills the same, and to derive from the

				-
			-
				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 19
			-

					If you are constantly on the lookout for the bad in others, you will find it
					where it is not and never was.

			-
				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 20
			-
				-
					To love one for their flaws is perversion, to love one for ignorance of their

				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 26
			-
				-
					If you fear to be a sheep following a shepherd, then make a shepherd of

				-
			-
				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 38

					on your account weep for you.
				-
			-
				Chapter 1 - On Morality: Verse 39
			-
				-

			-
				-
					To exalt cosmology over morality, and to derive either from people before
					principle, these are the definitions of idolatry.

				-
			-

			-
				Chapter 2 - On Life: Verse 25
			-
				-
					If a lost soul asks for a self-help sermon synthesized while standing on one
					foot, one may say to them: "bliss born in ignorance, and lost to life, may

				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - On Life: Verse 26
			-
				-
					An egg that fails to hatch becomes a prison; a prison with no parole becomes a

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 2
			-
				-
					To ponder the nature of reality is to ask how it is that your table made the

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Philosophy and science are the foundations of the modern world, yet great
					errors in judgement are inevitable when their places are confused.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 4
			-
				-
					A philosopher ignorant of science is stuck in the cave for fear of the light,
					but a scientist ignorant of philosophy ought to be stuck in the dark, for they

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 5
			-
				-

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 8
			-
				-
					The theory of natural selection is not that the fittest survive, but that
					whoever survives is, by definition, the fittest, and as memes and genes alike

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 9
			-
				-
					The truth is far deadlier to a fictitious foe than any contrived savior, but

			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Since time immemorial and unto the present day, it seems as though all attempts

			-
				-
					In the absence of presence, substance is but a single number, and its magnitude
					just the same.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 14
			-
				-
					A poet, in a pleasant daydream, may ponder if their word is alive in a
					figurative sense, but a programmer, in a rude awakening, may find that their
					word is alive in the literal sense.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 15

					of humanity, we have only ourselves to blame.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 18
			-
				-
					The "march" of progress is at times more like a drunken stupor; the world, in
					the course of evolution, trips, and it stumbles, and even falls from time to

					forward.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 19

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 22
			-
				-
					One's position, whatever it may be along the axis of any given spectrum, can
					only be amplified, projected, and rendered into extremism according to the
					measure of volume.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 23
			-
				-
					Many great enterprises have aimed towards utopia, though all have failed,
					because they defined themselves by their means rather than their ends, for
					heaven is neither communist nor capitalist, neither is it a dictatorship or a
					democracy, nay, rather, it is merely the destination unto which that perennial
					breed of political puritan aims and, without fail, misses.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 24
			-
				-
					That which roots itself in its fruit will bear none.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 25
			-
				-
					Tis' a shame that mobs and moderates mix miserably, making a moat of mutual
					exclusivity between efficacy and sanity, for thus does the pendulum plow the

			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 26
			-
				-
					If there is to be a constitution in utopia, let this be its preamble: To each

				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 27
			-
				-
					Though warnings may at times be mistaken for threats, do not, for the world's
					sake, hesitate to teach of its terrible truths, for the heavens shall hear no
					alibi on judgement day.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 28
			-
				-
					Do not blame the forecast when the storm comes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 29
			-
				-
					Is it so odd for the emperor to have no clothes in a world where nudity is the
					norm?
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 30
			-
				-
					When the thin facade of civilization collapses, nature paints the ruins red
					with the tooth and claw of man.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 31
			-
				-
					Some say that the ends do not justify the means, but it is certain that the
					means cannot justify the ends.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 32
			-
				-
					There is nothing inherently sacred in any human institution beyond the bounty
					they afford their namesake animal, for legal fiction is no more infallible than
					fiction in general, so fear not to be the arbiter in the room when the powers
					that be have failed to be.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 33
			-
				-
					Anyone exalted upon a pedestal will in time defile it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 34
			-
				-
					If you truly trust your word, then unto your herd, lace not the gates of wisdom
					with the barbs of bartering, for a monopoly on truth and a monopoly on its
					profit is to a prophet a cavity of mutual exclusivity which bears no crossing;
					verily, a price on the priceless renders it worthless.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 35
			-
				-
					If there be those that cease to walk in the way of their word, standing to it
					as a stumbling block instead, strike them down to Earth; for they have already
					fallen.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 36
			-
				-
					When the message is the messenger, you are being sold an idol at the expense of
					your sanity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 37
			-
				-
					A prophet walks so you may run; a deceiver runs so you may walk.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 38
			-
				-
					Preachers and proclamations that call to close the head or heart are the
					fabrications of false religions, so never think of thinking not as a virtue.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 39
			-
				-
					It is for a man to serve men, not for men to serve a man; and thus do you see
					what God cannot be, for there is no such thing as a worthy king.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 40
			-
				-
					Confuse not critical thought with cynical thought; nor education with
					indoctrination.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 41
			-
				-
					Education betrays itself when the elementary is made alien.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 42
			-
				-
					The worst mistake that one can make, when getting an education, is to assume
					that they have gotten one; for wisdom begins with knowing you know nothing.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 43

					room.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 46
			-
				-
					Scholarship sans skepticism is sick, and wisdom without doubt is dead; for
					questions never asked are never answered.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 47
			-
				-
					Submitting to blind faith is as easy as it is fruitless; only by wrestling with
					truth can it be known.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 48
			-
				-
					Knowledge is the fear of fear.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 49
			-
				-
					The impossible is infinitesimal.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 50
			-
				-
					To be; that is the order, and that is the answer.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - On Philosophy: Verse 51
			-
